_Codon_occurrence_to_off_frame_ratio_corr.py. The correlation relationship with codon content was analyzed Provide the species reference FASTA file and the input-data to be analyzed, and the correlation coefficient file and bar plot will be output. According to the input-data(such as RNA Decay, RNA Off frame ratio by Riboseq) to get CSC or COC.
_decoding_rate_RFS.py. The script is used to calculate the average level of relative decodes in RIBOSEQ data, need to enter the fasta reference file, as well as the bedgraph file after sequencing data processing, and select the 0, +1, -1 frame. The result outputs the corresponding codon decoding rate(CDR) for each codon.
_decay.py. The half-life was determined by analyzing reads that were normalized across multiple time points.
_make_reference_out-of-frame_peptide.py. Reference for building a mass spectrometry search.
