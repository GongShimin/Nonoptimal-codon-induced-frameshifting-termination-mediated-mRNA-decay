1. _Codon_occurrence_to_off_frame_ratio_corr.py. The correlation relationship with codon content was analyzed Provide the species reference FASTA file and the input-data to be analyzed, and the correlation coefficient file and bar plot will be output. According to the input-data(such as RNA Decay, RNA Off frame ratio by Riboseq) to get CSC or COC.

2. _decoding_rate_RFS.py. The script is used to calculate the average level of relative codon decoding rate in Ribo-seq data, need the fasta reference file and the bedgraph file after sequencing data processing as input, and select the 0, +1, -1 frame.

3. _decay.py. The half-life was determined by analyzing reads that were normalized across multiple time points.
